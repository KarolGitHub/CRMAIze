## High-Level Architecture

1. **Frontend UI:** Twig templates styled with Foundation, enhanced with Ajax calls and Web Workers for smooth user experience.
2. **Backend API:** PHP RESTful endpoints serve JSON data for customers, campaigns, and analytics.
3. **AI Layer:** Embedded AI logic in backend services for customer segmentation, churn prediction, and campaign suggestions.
4. **Data Storage:** Relational database holding customer records, campaign details, and engagement logs.
5. **Async Processing:** Web Workers handle heavy analysis tasks without blocking UI rendering.

---

## How It Works

- Customersâ€™ purchase data is imported or mocked and stored in the database.
- The AI module runs segmentation and churn-risk scoring asynchronously.
- Marketers build campaigns by selecting target segments and defining discounts or emails.
- The system generates personalized emails with Twig templates and optional AI-generated subject lines.
- Campaigns can be previewed, sent (simulated), and tracked.
- The dashboard visualizes KPIs, customer health, and campaign performance in real-time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PHP 7.4+ with PDO and SQLite extensions
- Composer (PHP package manager)
- Web server (Apache/Nginx) or built-in PHP server for development

### Quick Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CRMAIze.git
cd CRMAIze

# Run the installation script
php install.php

# Install dependencies
composer install

# Import sample data
php scripts/import_data.php

# Start the development server
php -S localhost:8000 -t public

# Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to set up manually:

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

2. **Configure environment:**

   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env file if needed
   ```

3. **Import sample data:**

   ```bash
   php scripts/import_data.php
   ```

4. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000 -t public
   ```

### Database Configuration

By default, CRMAIze uses SQLite for simplicity. The database file will be created automatically at `data/crmaize.db`.

For MySQL, update your `.env` file:

```
DB_DSN=mysql:host=localhost;dbname=crmaize;charset=utf8mb4
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### Deployment

CRMAIze is production-ready and can be deployed to various platforms:

#### **Render.com (Recommended)**

- Automatic deployments from Git
- Free tier available
- Built-in SSL certificates
- Easy environment variable management

#### **Heroku**

- Add-on support for databases
- Automatic scaling
- Git-based deployments

#### **VPS/Dedicated Server**

- Full control over the environment
- Custom domain and SSL setup
- Database optimization options

### Testing & Quality Assurance

#### **Accessibility Testing**

```bash
# Run the accessibility audit
php scripts/accessibility_audit.php

# Manual testing recommendations:
# 1. Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
# 2. Test keyboard-only navigation
# 3. Test with high contrast mode enabled
# 4. Validate with WAVE or axe-core tools
```

#### **Performance Testing**

```bash
# Run performance tests
php scripts/performance_test.php

# Check database performance
php scripts/db_optimization.php
```

#### **Security Testing**

```bash
# Run security audit
php scripts/security_audit.php

# Test authentication and authorization
php scripts/auth_test.php
```
